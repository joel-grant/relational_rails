## Learning Goals

This is the back-end of an application designed to create a one to many relation. Some of the concepts we learned were:

- Writing migrations to create tables with columns of varying data types and foreign keys
- Using Rails to create web pages that allow users to CRUD resources
- Creating class methods on a Rails model that uses ActiveRecord methods and helpers
- Write model and feature tests that cover the data logic completely
